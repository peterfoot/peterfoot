### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a .NET developer since the first Beta releases of the .NET Compact Framework. I've been awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) accolade since 2003 for involvement in the Microsoft .NET and Windows  developer communities. I write a lot about Bluetooth and mobile development. You can also find me here:-
